# How to build?

You should have `nix` and `npm` to be installed, moreover you must use unix shell

# If you don't have sae (you probably don't)

Just type
```Bash
chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
```

# If you have sae

Just type `sae freshBuild`

# Whats next?

Just wait until it generates optimized output files and then open `index.html` file in build directory
